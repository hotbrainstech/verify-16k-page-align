## Reporting a vulnerability

Please do not open public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.

- Submit a private report via GitHub Security Advisories: https://github.com/hotbrainstech/verify-16k-page-align/security/advisories/new
- If you cannot use advisories, you may open a minimal, non-exploitable issue requesting a security contact, and we will follow up privately.

### What to include

- A description of the issue and potential impact.
- Steps to reproduce or a proof of concept (PoC).
- Affected versions, if known.
- Any suggested mitigations.

### Our process and SLAs

- Triage within 2 business days.
- Status updates at least weekly while under investigation.
- If confirmed, we aim to publish a patch or mitigation within 14 days. Complex issues may take longer; we will communicate timelines.
- We credit reporters in release notes if desired and appropriate.

### Safe harbor

We will not pursue legal action for good-faith, non-destructive research that respects the following:

- Do not access, modify, or exfiltrate data you do not own.
- Do not degrade service or impact other users.
- Do not perform social engineering or physical security testing.

Thank you for your responsible disclosure and for helping improve the security of the ecosystem.
